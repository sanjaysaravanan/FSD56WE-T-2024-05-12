Topics:

  1. Working with Forms & basic data processing in reactjs
    Please refer src/Profile.jsx for form handling using useState

    Finish the CRUD application
  
  2. ref in react

      useRef() --> hook used to access the DOM element

      ref.current === e.target ( very similar ) 

        e.target can be only on actionable elements (button, form)

      **ref.current/e.target cannot be used to change/alter the contents of the DOM / DOM**
      should be used only for actions on the DOM Elements of application,

      1. Scrolling 
      2. Sliding
      3. Play an audio
      4. Stop an audio
      5. Resetting a form

      ** Ref should not be used to alter the DOM, it should only be used to do actions like above **

      key, ref both the cannot be used as a prop name for a component,
      because they used by VDOM to identify/capture a VDOM element

      Legacy One:
      
        createRef( creates a new reference everytime ) --> does the same thing as useRef but sometimes loses the reference if the component or the jsx is re-rendering

      always try to useRef hook
  
  3. Simple Movement Application into for game development using react,

      Simple Movement Application

Next Session:

  1. tictactoe
      2. Tile Match

  3. useReducer

      **reducer** is single function which can do multiple things using a set of instructions

      Handling Multiple different state values with single function

      Advanced version of useState:

        it can be used when we change the same state with more than three actions

  4. Game Development tictactoe:

      3 x 3 --> tictactoe
  
  5. Async Operations
